# Supply-Chain-Analytics
**1. Project Title / Headline**

An end-to-end cost analysis dashboard built to support strategic sourcing decisions. This interactive Power BI solution compares “make” vs “buy” scenarios across multiple parts and suppliers, enabling businesses to assess unit costs, non-recurring expenses, capital investment, and total cost implications. It empowers procurement teams to identify cost-saving opportunities and optimize supplier selection.

**2. Short Description / Purpose**
   
This dashboard provides a comprehensive comparison of make vs. buy scenarios for various parts, incorporating supplier quotes, unit costs, non-recurring expenses, and internal manufacturing capacity. It helps stakeholders make informed sourcing decisions that optimize total cost, minimize capital investment, and identify the most efficient procurement strategies.

**3. Tech Stack**
   
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.

• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.

• 📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.

• 📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables.

• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

**4. Data Source**

Excel-based sample dataset designed for supply chain and procurement analysis.

The data includes multiple tables such as Parts, Suppliers, Quotes, Manufacturing Costs, and Capacity. These tables are connected through unique IDs and structured in a relational format, allowing the dashboard to compare in-house production costs with supplier quotes across different parts and volumes.
